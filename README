The parser defines a language construct called if0

(if0 {test-expression}
     {then-expression}
     {else-expression})
     
The if0 evaluates the test-expression, and if the result is 
different from 0, it evaluates the then-expression,  if the 
result of the test-expression is 0, the else-expression  is 
evaluated.
